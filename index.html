                        Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in the flesh. One known and beloved by many. This look, however? Purely and utterly shameful. Embarrassing, horrendous, horrific; the list goes on. We may all be thinking, "AOC, girl, what was the goal here?" This dress was designed by Brooklyn-based designer brand Brother Vellies, and let us just say they are irrelevant for a reason or two. If the dress was nice-looking, it would have potentially made up for the monstrosity that is the full piece. It appears as though Ms. Cortez is headed on her way to play Carrie at the high school prom later tonight.

                     Pictured left, supermodel Iman Abdulmajid, well known as Iman, is wearing a stunning Dolce & Gabbana x Harris Reed piece. Undebatably best dressed at the 2021 Met Gala, Iman perfectly embodies the theme of American Independence while looking absolutely dazzling. She is believed to have taken inspiration from the 20s' decade, appearing as grandiose as can be. Iman looks like pure gold, and she's breaking necks in the best way. No whiplash here, ma'am.

                         Where do I start here, O, Addison Rae? Is it appropriate to first yodel? You are dressed like it is the medieval times during Christmas. A cheap, satin corset atop a flowy ruby dress? Rumor has it this dress is straight from SHEIN. I'd believe it, too--maybe she was on a budget this year. The worst thing about this look is the sheer laziness. The ridges around the shoulder, chest and stomach areas are the opposite of flattering and look tacky and cheap. Aside from the nonsense of the dress alone, what does this have anything to do with American Independence? Looks like little miss Addie wanted to play it safe (and also sorry...?) for her first Met Gala. Let's pray it's the last.
